          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>DIMENSIONS.</b>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
              dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length.
              These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
              under 12 and older.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b> Fields used within the competition
              program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or
              associations participating in the state competition program that
              are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
              requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
              assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to
              the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should
              be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are
              unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all
              their games away.
